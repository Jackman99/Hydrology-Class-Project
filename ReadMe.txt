The individual files named  "###_30years.csv", where ### is the SiteID of your basin, contain the following columns in the following order:

Year, Month, Day, Precipitation (P), Potential Evaporation (Ep), Total streamflow (Q), Fast flow - ie surface runoff (Qs), and Slow flow, ie baseflow (Qu)

where P, Ep, Q, Qs, and Qu in units of mm - ie, area-averaged values. 

The data is arranged in a continuous 30-year daily timeseries sorted by year, then month, then day. 

The years are calendar years, not water years, and each file may have a different start and end date.
